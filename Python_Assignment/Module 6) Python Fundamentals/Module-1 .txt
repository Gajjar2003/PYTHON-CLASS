1. Introduction to Python

     1. Introduction to Python and its Features (simple, high-level, interpreted language)
         Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language that is widely used for web development,
         data science, artificial intelligence, automation, and many other applications. It was created by
         Guido van Rossum in 1991 with the idea of making programming simple, readable, and beginner-friendly

         Features of Python
      
              1.  Simple and Easy to Learn

                Python has a clean and readable syntax.

                Looks similar to English, which makes it beginner-friendly.

              2.  High-Level Language

                Programmers donâ€™t need to worry about low-level details like memory management.

                It allows developers to focus on solving problems rather than managing hardware.

              3.  Interpreted Language

                Python code runs line by line using an interpreter.

                No need for compilation, which makes debugging easier.

             4.   Cross-Platform

                Python works on different operating systems like Windows, Mac, and Linux without changes in code.

              5.  Object-Oriented and Procedural

                Supports both object-oriented programming (classes, objects) and simple procedural programming.

              6. Extensive Standard Library

                Comes with built-in modules for math, file handling, networking, databases, etc.

                Also supports thousands of external libraries (like NumPy, Pandas, Django).

              7.  Free and Open Source

                Python is free to use and distribute, with a huge community of developers.

              8.  Dynamic Typing

                No need to declare variable types explicitly; Python decides the type at runtime.

              9.  Portable

                The same Python program can run on multiple platforms without modification.
